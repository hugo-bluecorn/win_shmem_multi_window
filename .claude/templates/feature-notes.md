## TDD Approach

### Test Strategy
Following TDD principles, we'll create tests first for all implementations, then create the implementation to make the tests pass.

**Test Framework:** [e.g., test, flutter_test, integration_test]

### Red Phase - Tests to Write
1. Test 1: [Test description]
2. Test 2: [Test description]
3. Test 3: [Test description]

**Goal:** All tests fail initially (expected)

### Green Phase - Implementation
1. Implement minimal code to pass Test 1
2. Implement minimal code to pass Test 2
3. Implement minimal code to pass Test 3

**Goal:** All tests pass

### Refactor Phase - Code Quality
1. Refactor for readability
2. Extract reusable components
3. Improve performance if needed
4. Ensure tests still pass

**Goal:** Clean, maintainable code
